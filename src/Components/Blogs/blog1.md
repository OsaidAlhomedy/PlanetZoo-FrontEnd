## 5 Animals That are Going to Extinct:

Who is to blame if Earth is on the verge of the "sixth mass extinction," as many scientists believe? Why is there such a dramatic reduction in biodiversity, and how can we stop it?
Humans are responsible for the majority of the problems that endangered animals face. Researchers warned in 2020 that more than 500 vertebrate species are on the verge of extinction in the next 20 years. Human behavior is driving this extinction disaster first and foremost.
And here is a list of it :

1-Saola:
According to the IUCN, the greatest threat to the severely endangered saola, which was discovered only a few years ago in 1992, is hunting, with the mammal being particularly sensitive to dog hunting. Experts believe the “saola cannot be rescued without accelerated dismantling of poachers' snares and reduction of hunting with dogs in crucial regions of the Annamite forests,” according to the IUCN in 2009.

2- Amur Leopard
The Amur Leopard is a severely endangered species. Because of "severe habitat degradation and conflict with humans," the Amur leopard is considered "important." Conversion of land for farming is one of the main causes of habitat loss. The WWF points out that agriculture has an indirect impact on the leopard's fate. “The leopards' habitat is surrounded by agriculture and villages. 

3-Black Rhino and Northern White Rhino
Although poaching for rhino horns is widely acknowledged as the biggest threat to the Black rhino and other rhinos, Save the Rhino considers habitat loss to be “a substantial hazard to rhino populations.”

4- The Cross River Gorilla
According to the IUCN Red List, the Cross River Gorilla is highly endangered and was formerly thought to be extinct. Along with hunting, habitat degradation is one of the dangers the great ape faces. The Cross River Gorilla is also in risk from animal agriculture.

5- Hawksbill sea turtle
The fishing industry is one of the most serious threats to the endangered hawksbill sea turtle. Hawksbills, which are at risk of having their eggs harvested or being slaughtered for their meat or shells, are also endangered by farm run-off, which includes fertilizers.
