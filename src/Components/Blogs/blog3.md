# Proofs that Michael Jackson Cared about Animals: 
## The Story Behind Earth Song.


Although he was known for his epic songs and Dance anthems, The king of bob Michael Jackson cared about animals and environmental issues, and that was what made him scream “What about Us”.

Earth Song' was released as the third single from Michael Jackson's 1995 album HIStory, following 'Scream' and 'You Are Not Alone.' Michael later commented on the song's creation, saying: “ "I remember writing 'Earth Song' when I was in Austria, in a hotel. And I was feeling so much pain and so much suffering of the plight of the planet Earth.”

Michael is issuing a sort of wake-up call about the horrible state of the world that humans have caused, from war to the slaughter of animals and the destruction of the planet itself. The song becomes more spiritual as it progresses, with Michael reminding listeners that the earth is their legacy from God.

“
What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son?
What about flowering fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine?
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores? 
”
The song was shot in four different locations. The first site was the Amazon Rainforest, which had been destroyed in huge parts just a week after the documentary was finished. The video also featured local residents who were not actors. The second scene depicts a combat zone in Karlovac, Croatia, with Slobodan Dimitrijevic, a well-known Serbian actor, and locals.
Tanzania was the third site, with scenes of unlawful poaching and hunting. The video was made with footage from documentary archives, thus no animals were injured in the process. In Warwick, New York, a safe forest fire was simulated in a cornfield for the final location. All that proves that the king of bob cared about Animals a lot during his lifetime, and did his best to awaken people for this important issue.
