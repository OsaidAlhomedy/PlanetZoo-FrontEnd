## Interesting facts about animals that already Extinct: 


Natural events such as climatic change, as well as warming in sea levels, can trigger animal extinctions. Human action has been blamed in more recent times, however. The main cause of modern extinctions, along with pollution, the introduction of foreign species, and overfishing and hunting, is habitat destruction as farming land grows and forests are chopped down. However, here is a list of facts about animals that are already extinct: 

1- Dodo
The Dodo was a flightless bird that lived in Mauritius and was about one meter tall and weighed 10â€“18 kg. The only account of the Dodo's appearance that we have is through various pictures and textual tales from the 17th century, therefore its exact look is unknown. Because of the abundance of food supplies (seeds, roots, and fallen fruits) and the lack of predators, the bird is thought to have become flightless. The dodo was originally mentioned by Dutch sailors in 1598. Sailors and their tamed animals, as well as exotic species, hunted the bird to extinction. In 1662, the least commonly accepted sighting of a Dodo occurred.

2- Woolly Mammoth
A large creature that is thought to be linked to the current elephant. About 3.5 million years ago, its ancestors left Africa and moved throughout northern Eurasia and North America. The monster stood over 4 meters tall and weighed over 6 tons. Their fur was thick, and their curved tusks might easily reach 5 meters in length! The Woolly Mammoth became extinct 10,000 years ago as a result of human hunting and the disappearance of its habitat due to climate change. Around 1700BC, the last of the isolated woolly mammoth populations perished from Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean.

3- Sabre-toothed Cat
They lived 55 million to 11,700 years ago and were known as Sabre-toothed Tigers or Sabre-toothed Lions. Sabre-tooth Cats were carnivores with elongated bladelike canine teeth that might reach 50cm in length in some species. They were said to be outstanding hunters and hunted animals such as sloths and mammoths because of their bear-like physique.
