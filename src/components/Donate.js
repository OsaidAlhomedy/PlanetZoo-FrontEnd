<h3> Why People Donate:</h3>
<p className="paragraph1">Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.
</p>
<p className="paragraph1" > Many people are concerned that their donations to charity may be reduced by tax or administrative costs, preventing the full amount from reaching the people or causes they really want to help. Thankfully because of the low fees, you can make sure that you gave the most of every donation to charity.</p>
<p className="paragraph1">
  Also, Your own charitable donations can inspire your nearest and dearest to give to causes important to them, and could even bring about a family-wide effort to back a charity or charities that have special significance to you as a group.
 <p className="paragraph1"> Several people choose to support charities that help endangered animals, some opt to live an eco-friendly lifestyle, and others decide to actively volunteer. There are so many ways to support the creatures that share this planet with us, and one of the simplest ways is to donate to endangered animal charities. </p>
</p>
<p className="paragraph1"> We know that many species of animals and plants are endangered. It is our duty to save the world because the reduction in the forest is leading to many environmental changes and especially global warming that would lead to the destruction of the world. By giving, the donation to the NGOs that work for animals and natural habitat will provide them a chance to protect the forests, the animals, and plants. They work by developing different natural parks where animals can get jungle like the atmosphere or transferring them to a better habitat.</p>

<p className= "para"> If you want to Donate with food to the stray animals, we Got you.. </p>
  
<p className= "para">Thousands of stray animals are often abused, neglected, and have no one to care for them. PlanetZoo Foundation was started to shelter these abandoned animals - to give them a safe home, feed them and rehabilitate them. Our vision is to live in a world where humans respect and live in harmony with animals, and today, we're a step closer to this all because of you! Thanks to your generous contributions, we have been feeding 500+ stray dogs in nearby localities since the onset of lockdown. We have been able to provide dog food to these stray dogs who often depend on people's kindness to survive. The pandemic was especially difficult for these loving animals, but with your help, we have been able to nourish them back to health. Thank you so much for your support! </p>
